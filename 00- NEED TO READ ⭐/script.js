//      Hi, Everyone! I am D.N. Sathvara. This documentation is published by me, and it is a must-read for beginners.

//      Every coder says that JS is a great language, and you must have knowledge of JS.
//  But for many students and beginners, JS can be tough to grasp.
//  I created this documentation to explain JavaScript in simple English. In this document,
//  I will share the knowledge I've gathered after watching multiple tutorials,
//  learning from my mistakes, and gaining hands-on experience.

//                                     ==> JS BASIC KNOWLEDGE DOCUMENTATION <==


// You might be wondering: **Why should I read this documentation? 🤔**


//        ==> I explain all the basic concepts of JavaScript in detail, based on my own experience of learning from various tutorials.
//  This documentation is built
//        to help you understand JS more clearly.
//  Please feel free to update or correct any mistakes you might find in this documentation!
